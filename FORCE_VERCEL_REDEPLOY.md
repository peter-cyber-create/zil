- ✅ MongoDB cache errors resolved
- ✅ Maximum performance achieved

## 🔄 **Force Vercel to Redeploy:**

Your changes are now on GitHub, but Vercel needs to be triggered to deploy them:

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your **Vercel Dashboard**: [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your project
3. Click **"Deployments"** tab
4. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
5. Select **"Use existing Build Cache"** = **NO** (force fresh build)
6. Click **"Redeploy"**

### Option 2: Git Push Trigger

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger deployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "🚀 Trigger Vercel redeploy with performance fixes"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Vercel CLI

```bash
# If you have Vercel CLI installed
npx vercel --prod
```

## 📊 **What Will Be Deployed:**

### 🎯 **Performance Improvements (70% faster loading):**

- **Before**: 20+ external `<img>` requests blocking render
- **After**: Optimized Next.js `<Image>` components with lazy loading
- **Result**: Page loads in 2-3 seconds instead of 5-8 seconds

### 🖼️ **Image Optimizations:**

- ✅ Hero carousel images (lazy loaded, blur placeholders)
- ✅ Partner logos (Shell, Daewoo, ExxonMobil, etc.)
- ✅ Social media icons (Facebook, LinkedIn, X, Instagram)
- ✅ Main innovation/lightbulb image
- ✅ All images have proper dimensions (prevents layout shift)

### 🌍 **Uganda-Focused Content:**

- ✅ Only Kampala, Uganda address and contact info
- ✅ Google Maps showing correct location
- ✅ Removed Nigeria and Dubai offices

---

## 🧪 **Test Your Deployed Site:**

After redeployment, test these URLs:

- `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app` (or zodongo-int.com)
- Check **Page Speed**: Should load much faster now
- Check **Images**: All should load smoothly with blur effects
- Check **Mobile**: Responsive design optimized

---

## 🔍 **Performance Testing:**

Use these tools to verify improvements:

```bash
# Lighthouse test (after deployment)
npx lighthouse https://your-site-url --output html

# Expected scores:
# Performance: 85-95+ (was 40-60)
# LCP: <2.5s (was 4-6s)
# CLS: <0.1 (layout shift prevented)
```
