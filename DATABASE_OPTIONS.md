# Alternative: Use Vercel KV (Redis) for Simple Data Storage

## If PostgreSQL seems complex, you can use Vercel KV:

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Storage → Create Database → KV (Redis)
   - Much simpler setup

2. **Update your data handling:**
   - Store contacts/feedback as JSON in KV store
   - No complex schema needed
   - Perfect for simple contact forms

3. **Pros:**
   - Instant setup
   - No schema migration needed
   - Very fast
   - Free tier generous

4. **Cons:**
   - Less structured than SQL
   - Different query patterns

## Recommendation: 
**Go with PostgreSQL** - it's more robust for your business needs and supports your existing Prisma schema without changes.
