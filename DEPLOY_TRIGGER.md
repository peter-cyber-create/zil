# Deployment Trigger

This file is created to force Vercel to deploy from the latest commit.

**Current timestamp**: July 1, 2025 - 20:49:00

**Latest commit**: 6d17798 - "Force Vercel deployment: Trigger fresh deploy from ESLint-free codebase"

**Issue**: Vercel is stuck deploying from old commit `fc11fd3` which has ESLint.

**Solution**: This file change will trigger a new deployment from the latest ESLint-free commit.
